**'Kinda Chamma (Developer)'**

I'm a junior software developer sharing my experience throughout my academic journey and personal projects.

All coding projects are explained as much as possible.

I completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at Avignon University, France, with an exchange at Linnaeus University, Sweden, in 2024. I am currently enrolled in an Erasmus Mundus Master's program, specializing in advanced machine learning and optimization for sustainable systems.

  <summary><h3>Kinda's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
  I started my coding journey during my first year of undergraduate studies. I became particularly interested in operating systems courses because they combined coding logic with concrete examples of the machines we use today. During an exchange program in Sweden, I discovered my passion for cybersecurity. However, after graduating, I decided to specialize in Advanced Machine Learning and Optimization for Sustainable Systems. I believe I can bring an ethical perspective from cybersecurity into the rapidly growing field of machine learning.
  
The majority of the code sources that I have completed until now cannot be published because they concern some specific courses and projects, however I can show them per request.
Main projects : 
  <li><b>Product Recall Android Mobile Application </b>: <i>Java</i> | Save/delete/favorite products listed using an API, modify products info.</li>
  <li><b>Europe Wisdom Project </b>: <i>Python, HTML, JS, SQL </i> | Worked on author name disambiguation, analyzing the proportion of female authors in publications throughout the years, tested the anomalies that could bias the results.</li>
  <li><b> French Robotics Championship '24</b>: <i>Atmega2560, Arduino</i> | Coded the movement of the grippers and the movements of the robot to collect plants and put them where needed. </li>
  <li><b>Tic-Tac-Toe Game</b>: <i>JavaFX and Scene Builder</i> | Two options: Human vs Human and Human vs AI, use an AI to have a difficulty level, use transitions.</li>
  <li><b>Model a Percolation System</b>: <i>Java</i> | Used the model to determine with what probability a system percolates if sites areset to open with probability p.</li>
  <li><b>Huffman Coding</b>: <i>Java</i> | Program that reads a text file, computes the frequency for each character, and creates a Huffman tree.</li>
  <li><b>Software Platform for Monitoring an IT infrastructure</b>: <i>Bash and python</i> | Parse a website and save specific informations, list live alerts, develop a web interface with graphs.</li>
  <li><b> Robot Arm Color Detector </b>: <i> Atmega2560, Arduino</i> | Used Color Captors to distinguish colors, implemented 3D pieces to create the arm using Fusion360, developed a Bluetooth-enabled color selection application.</li>
  <li><b> Binary Compression/ Decompression</b>: <i>C++</i> | Transformed UTF-8 text into binary and compressed it referring to the concept of trees and lists, vice versa. </li>
  <li><b> Hotel Reservation Website </b>: <i>HTML, CSS, PHP, SQL</i> | Created a website on which we can make hotel reservation within specified dates. Cancelations and modifications are also handled. </li>
