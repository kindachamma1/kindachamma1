**'Kinda Chamma (Developper)'**
I'm a junior software developper sharing my experience throughout my academic journey and personal projects.

All coding projects are explained as much as possible. 

I finished my bachelor degree in Computer Science at Avignon University|France, with an exchange at Linnaeus University|Sweden in 2024. I am currently enrolled in an eramsus mundus master program, specializing in advanced machine learning and optimization for sustainable systems.
