**Kinda Chamma (Developper)**

I'm a junior software developper sharing my experience throughout my academic journey and personal projects.

All coding projects are explained as much as possible. 

I finished my bachelor degree in Computer Science at Avignon University|France, with an exchange at Linnaeus University|Sweden in 2024. I am currently enrolled in an eramsus mundus master program, specializing in advanced machine learning and optimization for sustainable systems.

  <summary><h3>Kinda's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
I started my coding journey during my first year of undergraduate studies. I became particularly interested in operating systems courses because they combined coding logic with concrete examples of the machines we use today. During an exchange program in Sweden, I discovered my passion for cybersecurity. However, after graduating, I decided to specialize in Advanced Machine Learning and Optimization for Sustainable Systems. I believe I can bring an ethical perspective from cybersecurity into the rapidly growing field of machine learning.
